# Quick WCA Competitions Search


Run `./setup.sh` to start using the tool.
This will create the required local files, and ask to create an alias in ~/.zshrc

*A future improvement to this will be to install program files in /usr/bin (on MacOS) to avoid alias creation.
An uninstaller could remove the files if the user wishes to.

Run `./main` or your provided alias name to check for new competitions.
